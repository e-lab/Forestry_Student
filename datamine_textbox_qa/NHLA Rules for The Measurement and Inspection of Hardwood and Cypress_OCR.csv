Hardwood lumber came from sustainable harvested, self regenerating, non-coniferous trees. Most are broad leaf and deciduous though there are a few exceptions. Softwood lumber is produced from coniferous trees which are predominantly necklir bearing and non-decidious or evergreen. Because of the differing inherent qualities, growth characteristics and end use of hashwords compared to softwoods, their grading methods are substantially different. In general, a softwood board is graded as a whole piece, whereas a hashwood board is graded on its usable content aside from any parts which may be considered undesirable for in use such as knots, name, splitz, etc.

The hardwood grades have been adopted to establish the comparable value of the board and to provide the user with a standard on which he may base his purchase for a particular end use. A chair manufacturer can utilize a board which contains shorter and narrower clear or sound pieces (cutings), whereas a manufacturer of case goods or tables may require longer or wider cuttings or both. The grading rules are of further advantage in that they apply generally to all species with certain exceptions. Other rules have been established for particular end use such as piano actions, key stock, pancing, and for particular types of construction where strength and size may be a factor.

The rules are the result of long and careful study by practical lumbermen in cooperation with the user, with the aim of providing the best available products, conservation of the timber from which it is cut and in maintaining a lumber language of terms and specifications which permit a ready and understandable meeting of the minds among buyers and sellers wherever and for whatever use hardwoods are required. As a consequence, the rules are used universally with well-founded confidence.

The underlying codification of the rules was made with the formation of the National Hardwood Lumber Association in 1897 and since that time has been revised or enlarged to reflect the industry's needs with the advice of a standing committee representing the various species and producing areas.

The Association provides short term instructional courses and a full-time training school available to members and non-members alike so that a full and uniform understanding and application of the rules may be achieved.

To further the interests and provide for the protection of the buyer and seller of hardwoods, the Association maintains a staff of highly qualified inspector whose services are available on request to both members and non-members.

"
4,"Their duties are to grade the lumber as specified in the written order given to them based on National rules and to provide where applicable a certificate covering their work. Such certificates are financially guaranteed by the Association as covered by the regulations governing their issuance.

From the adoption of the earliest hardwood rules, no major alteration of standards has occurred that was not prompted by a noticeable change in the character of the hardwood timber supply. Practical hardwood operators have an awareness of the obligation to strive to make the rules bear a reasonable and practical relationship to the general quality of the available timber supply. Conservation is promoted by the maintenance of this type of sensible relationship between the lumber rules and the raw material from which the lumber is produced.

Before a rule is amended or a new rule adopted, the proposal is carefully considered by the Rink Committee compound of hardwoodgable, experienced lumbermen. If the proposal passes the scrutiny of this Committee, it is then debated and voted upon by the Active membership of the Association. If the proposal is passed by a two-thirds majority vote, it then becomes official and is included in the Rink.

A study of the Sales Code in recommended. It was written by practical lumblemmen of wide experience and high meal values. As will be seen in the preamble, in use it designed to create a basin for a meeting of the minds and to provide a ready means for the settlement of dispute without recourse to litigation. Its provisions are stipulated in an ever-increasing number of sale and purchase contracts.

The grading and measurement of hardwood lumber is not a simple matter and should not be undertaken lightly. A constant review and study of the individual rules is advisable even by those who are constantly using them. No rules or regulations can be truly effective unless they are understood and correctly applied. Those presented in the following pages have stood the test of time and of an exacting market. They have served as a pattern for other and are outstanding example of the determined efforts of a great and basic industry to conduct its affairs on the most profound effect of all time. The Golden Rule.

## General instructions

1. Inspectors are instructed to study these rules carefully and use their best judgment in applying them, but shall not allow their judgements to supersede anything specifically stated in the rules themselves.
2. All lumber shall be inspected according to these rules as defined under General Inturations and Standard Inspection unlaw otherwise specified. The rules defined under Special Combined & Face Gards shall be applied only when specified in the contract between buyer and seller. The rules under Standard Inspection and Special Inspection shall not be applied under any contract which specifies grade names different from those listed herein except by special agreement between buyer and seller.
3. Exceptions to the General Inturations and Standard Gards are stated under the caption of the respective special and grades.
4. Lumber shall be inspected and measured as the important finds it, of full length, width and thickness. No allowance shall be made for the purpose of raising the grade, except that in rough stock, wane, and other defects which can be removed by surfacing to standard soap thickness shall not be considered. Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the shipper from imposing the grade or appearance of the lumber at time of or prior to shipment. The surface grade as determined by the curting yield shall first be established by the inspector, after which the thickness shall be determined. Thickness does not determine grade. After grade and thickness have been determined, special features, such as the amount of forty-five degree radial grain for classification as quarter seven lumber and the amount of figure as specified for figured woods and some quartered woods, shall be considered.
5. The grade shall be determined from the poor side of the piece, except when otherwise specified. In the cutting grades the poor side of the board is determined by the side with the lower grade, or if both sides have the same grade, it is the side with the least number of cutting units. When determining the poor side of a board, grade each face independently without regard to the reverse side of the cutting. After the post side has been determined, then look to the reverse side for soundnes.

"
6,"These rules define the poorest piece in any given Standard or Special grades, but the respective grades shall contain all pieces up to the next higher Standard or Special grade as defined in these rules.
* All widths, lengths and thicknesses mentioned in these rules shall be inclusive. These rules do not define standard average widths or lengths and in all cases which a specific average width or length or a specific percentage of any width or length or groups of widths or lengths is required, it is incumbent upon the buyer to specify same in the contract.

### Manufacture

* Lumber should be properly manufactured of good, average width and lengths. It should be added and trimmed carefully to produce the best possible appearance while conserving the usable product of the log. Shipments of rough lumber will admit 25% of surfaced lumber when it is of the specified rough thickness. Contraces for green lumber should specify dimensions required to provide for shrinkage in drying.

### Miscurt Lumber

* Rough lumber shall be categorized for Standard Thickness by the measurement taken at the thinnest cutting used in establishing the grade. If there is a greater variation in thickness over the entire length of the piece than shown in the following table, the board shall be classed about that.
* 3/8"", 1/2"", 5/8"", and 3/4"" minus 0"" / plus 3/16""
* 4/4 and 5/4 minus 0"" / plus 1/4""
* 6/4 and 7/4
* 8/4, 10/4 and 1/2/4
* 1/4/4 to 2/4

In determining the variation in thickness of Quarcerd lumber, the same thickness of 1/16"" and 1/8"" admitted in those species under Paragraph 36, shall not be included.

 "
7,"

### Minimum Widths:

10. Ninety percent of the minimum widths mentioned in all grades of lumber shall be full width; the remaining ten percent may be up to 1/4deg scant in width. This rule also applies to each mock width and to any specified width. Width of the pierc is determined at the narrowest point in the standard length with a scorn edge.

### Specified Widths SIE or S2E

11. Lumber of specified width, rough or draved one or two sides, when draved one or two sides shall be 3/8deg scant of the nominal width in lumber less than 8deg wick and 1/2deg scant of the nominal width in lumber 8deg and wider.

### Standard Lengths

12. Standard lengths are: 4deg, 5deg, 6deg, 7deg, 8deg, 9deg, 10deg, 11deg, 12deg, 13deg, 14deg, 15deg and 16deg.

### Standard Thicknesses

13. Standard thicknesses for rough lumber are: 3/8deg, 1/2deg, 5/8deg, 3/4deg, 1deg,

1-1/4deg, 1-1/2deg, 1-3/4deg, 2deg, 2-1/2deg, 3deg, 3-1/2deg, 4deg, 4-1/2deg, 5deg, 5-1/2deg, and 6deg. One inch and thicker may also be expressed in quarter inches as follows: 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4, 8/4, 10/4, 12/4, 14/4, 16/4, 18/4, 20/4, 22/4 and 2/4/4.

### Standard Thickness for Surfaced Lumber

14. Standard thickness for unfaced lumber is calculated by subtracting 3/16deg from standard rough thickness for lumber 1-1/2deg thick or less and by subtracting 1/4deg for lumber between 1-3/4deg and 4deg thick as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l l l l}
**Rough** & **Surfaced** & **Rough** & **Surfaced** \\
3/8deg & 52S  3/16deg & 1-3/4deg & 52S  1-1/2deg \\
1/2deg & 52S  5/16deg & 2deg & 52S  1-3/4deg \\
5/8deg & 52S  7/16deg & 2-1/2deg & 52S  2-1/4deg \\
3/4deg & 52S  9/16deg & 3deg & 52S  2-3/4deg \\
1deg & 52S  13/16deg & 3-1/2deg & 52S  3-1/4deg \\
1-1/4deg & 52S  1-1/16deg & 4deg & 52S  3-3/4deg \\
1-1/2deg & 52S  1-5/16deg & & \\ \end{tabular}
15. Thickness of lumber surfaced on one side only, shall be subject to special contract.

## Measurement & Tally

16. Board feet is the unit of measure of number. One board feet is 12\({}^{*}\) wide by 12\({}^{*}\) long and 1\({}^{*}\) thick (144 cubic inches) or the equivalent. Surface Measure in the unit of measure to express the number of square feet on the surface of a board without regard so thickness. Surface measure is expressed in whole feet and rounded up or down to the nearest whole number when being calculated. Board feet is calculated by multiplying the surface measure by the standard thickness, except that standard thicknesses less than 1\({}^{*}\) are measured as 1\({}^{*}\). In random width lumber measured with a board rule, fractions of a foot below the half are dropped and fraction of a foot higher than the half are commed so the next higher whole font. Widths measuring to the even half feet are counted accurately to the next higher or lower foot. In standard length lumber any fractions of feet longer than the standard lengths are dropped to the next lower standard length. In surfaced lumber, board footage is measured before surfacing.

Unless otherwise specified, reference to percentages applies to board feet and not to the number of pieces. See page 36 for measurement regulations concerning skin dried lumber.

**Note**: End Tally refers to the method of board footage measurement where lumber is tallied on a 12 Fe. basis as described in paragraph 21 except all width measurements are taken from the ends of boards after the lumber has been stacked in bundles.

It is recognized that there will be some minor differences in end tally measurement from ""board measure"" method. In cases of footage dispute caused by the use of both measurement methods, the footage as determined by ""board measure"" will supersede.

17. Tapering lumber in standard lengths shall be measured one-third the length of the piece from the narrow end for surface measure and to record footage on length and width talles.

18. Random width lumber of standard grades and thickness shall be tallied surface measure and this tally shall be the number of feet, board measure, of 1\({}^{*}\) lumber. In lumber thicker than 1\({}^{*}\) the tally so obtained is multiplied by the standard thickness as expressed in inches and fractions of an inch.

Except squares, lumber less than 1\({}^{*}\) thick shall be counted surface measure.

"
9,"19. Strips and stock-widths shall be called and counted as of their nominal specified widths and lengths.
20. Rough dimension stock shall be counted as of the nominal specified size. When surfaced it shall be counted as of the nominal rough size required in its manufacture.

### Tallying on I2 Ft. Basis

11. The terms ""export tally,"" ""width and length tally"" and ""tally on 12 \(\hat{\text{n}}\).

\(\hat{\text{n}}\)"" are synonymous. The term ""tally on 12 \(\hat{\text{n}}\). has"" a more definite because the width of 12' number in the same as the surface measure on the board rule. On this basis, the lengths are called separately. In tallying, the width, pieces meaning to the even half inch are alternately counted as of the next higher or lower width. Fractions below the half inch are dropped and fractions above the half inch are counted as of the next higher width. After the tally is figured, the proper fraction in added or subtracted in order to obtain the correct measure, thus: for 4' length, divide the total by 3; 6' divide by 2; 3' subtract 1/3; 9' subtract 1/4; 10' subtract 1/6; 11' subtract 1/12; 13' add 1/12; 14' add 1/6; 15' add 1/4; 16' add 1/3; 5' and 7' multiply by the length and divide by 12. A short method to figure width and length tallying is to multiply the width by number of pieces for each width. Multiply this total by length of pieces and divide by 12. If number is thicker than one inch, multiply by thickness. This method of tallying should not be confined with tallying weck widths such as 1 x 6"", 1 x 8"", etc.

### Season Checks

12. Season checks are considered ordinary and are admitted in clear face cuttings if they will draw out at standard surfaced thickness. Season checks that do not impair the strength are admitted in Sound Cutting and Construction grades.

### Sapwood - Heartwood

13. Unlimited approach or heartwod is admitted unless otherwise specified. Contracts for special grades under a heartwod or approach specification shall state the maximum or minimum percentage of heartwod or approach desired and how it shall be calculated, whether in width, length, girth, facial or surface arc.

## 1 Introduction

The study of the evolution of the universe is a very important subject of research.

### Clear-Face Cutting

A coating having one clear face (ordinary season checks are admitted) and the reverse side sound as defined in Sound Cutting. The clear face of the cutting shall be on the poor side of the band except when otherwise specified.

### Sound Cutting

31. A cutting free from rot, pin, shake and wane. Texture is not considered. It will admit sound knots, bird pecka, stain, streak or their equivalence, season checks not materially impairing the strength of a cutting, pin, shot and spot worm holes. Other holes 1/4"" or larger are admitted but shall be limited as follows: one 1/4"" in average diameter in each coating of less than 12 units; two 1/4"" or one 1/2"" to each 12 units and on one side only of a cutting.

### Check

32. A length-wise separation of the wood that usually extends across the rings of annual growth and commonly results from stresses act up in wood during scanning.

### Mineral Streak

33. An olire to greenish-black or brown distribution of undetermined cause in hardwoods.

### Sound Knot

34. A knot that is solid across in face, hard as the surrounding wood and shows no indication of decay.

### Quartered Lumber

35. In species where figure is not required, pieces shall be considered quartered when 80% of the surface of the required croupings in the aggregate shows the radial grain at an angle of 45deg or less with one face.
36. In ten percent of a shipment of quartered lumber when shipping dry, the required cutting may be 1/16"" scant in thickness on one edge provided the other edge of the cutting is full standard thickness in thickness up to and including 7/4""; in 8/4"" and thicker they may be 1/8"" scant on one edge, provided the other edge is full standard thickness.

"
12,"* 37. CUTTING UNIT METHOD: the method used to measure the amount of usable read in boards. A cutting unit is 1"" wide and 1 for long or the equivalent. There are 12 cutting units in 1 square foot at 1 foot of surface measure. Cutting units are calculated by multiplying the width of a cutting measured in inches and fractions of an inch by the length measured in feet and fractions of a foot. The number of units obtained in the cuttings of a board are sealed and used as one requirement in the individual grades. To determine the number of cutting units required by each grade, the surface measure in multiplied an follow:

Yield requirement
* 11.64/12 97% \(\left\{ \text{m}1.67\% \right\}\) \(\left\{ \text{m}1.67\% \right\}\) \(\left\{ \text{m}1.

 "
13,"* [39] TO DETERMINE one-sixth the length of a board, multiply the length in feet by 2. The result will be the required number of inches in length thus, one-sixth the length of a 6' board is 12"". One-sixth the length of a 7"" board is 14"".
* [40] TO DETERMINE one-third the length of a board, multiply the length by 4. The result will be the required number of inches in length.
* [42] TO DETERMINE 1/12 of the required cutting area, the amount of square inches permitted is equivalent to the number of cutting units required for the grade. Example: A 6' SM needs 60 cutting units for FAS and would be permitted 60 square inches of mineral in FAS Red Oak.
* [43] TO DETERMINE one-fourth of the cutting area, divide the number of required cutting units by tree.
* [44] 6' SM needs 60 cutting units for FAS and would be permitted 30 square inches of mineral streak for FAS White Maple.
* [45] TO DETERMINE the average width of lumber will be 12"" basis. Divide the total width in inches by the total number of pieces. The result is the average width in inches.
* [46] TO DETERMINE the average width of lumber when not collapsing on 12"" basis: Tally the surface feet of each piece in separate columns under each length. After totaling surface feet, the proper fraction is applied to change surface feet to width in inches; thus, for 4' length, multiply the surface feet by 3; for 5' multiply by 2-2/5; for 6' multiply by 2; for 7', multiply by 1-5/7; for 8' multiply by 1-1/2; for 9' multiply by 1-1/3; for 10' multiply by 1-1/5; for 11' multiply by 1-1/11; for 12' the surface feet is the same as the surface width for 13' subtract 1/13; for 14' subtract 1/7; for 15' subtract 1/5; for 16' subtract 1/4. When the surface feet has been translated to width in inches the method of determining the average width of the lumber called on the above basis is the same as for lower talked on the 12' basis.

 "
14,"* [46] TO DETERMINE the average length of number, multiply the number of pieces by their length, which will give the total lineal footage, and divide the result by the total number of pieces.

**Example**

t0 pieces 10\({}^{\circ}\) = t00 l=cal feet

# pieces 12\({}^{\circ}\) = 96 linal feet

6 pieces 14\({}^{\circ}\) = 84 linal feet

t2 pieces 16\({}^{\circ}\) = 192 local feet

Total 36 pieces = 432 local feet

Dwding 472 by 36 equals 13.1\({}^{\circ}\) average length.

* TO DETERMINE the average diameter of a knot or hole, add the maximum length and maximum width and divide by two.

* TO DETERMINE the amount of thin linker obtained by removing a piece amount of various thicknesses:

* For 344 reason once, multiply the original surface measure by 2;
* For 644 reason once, multiply the original surface measure by 2;
* reason twice multiply by 3\({}^{\circ}\) reason there times, multiply by 4;
* For 344 reason twice, multiply the original surface measure by 3.

**Note:**_When number for been reason and sold as rack, the pieces obtained from a different brand should be kept together, inspected as the user surface and called as one piece. When she pieces are not kept together and it is now possible to inspect them as one piece, then each piece must be inspected and tabled individually. Before applying such inspection at denominator the lower should inform the seller of the condition of the transfer and they should agree on the basis of the inspection._ "

**Inspection of Cypress LUMBER**

**General Instruction**

**Note:**: _National Handaosed Lumber Association Inspector will apply these rules when called upon to inspect cyrees transfer rules otherwise specified._

1. These rules for Cypress are complete under this caption and are not to be confused with any standard grades or other species shown elsewhere in this book.
2. Requests to Association inspectors for inspection of Cypress at leading point should be accompanied by a copy of the order on which shipment is to be made. Requests for inspection at destination should also be accompanied by copy of order, but in the absence of such information the inspector will grade the lumber according to the following standard Cypress grades giving preference to grades in the order named: Selects & Bettir, No. 1 Common, No. 2 Common, and Peck.
3. Lumber shall be inspected and measured as the inspector finds it, of full length and width. He shall make no allowance for the purpose of raising the grade, except that imperfections in rough seek which can be removed in drawing to standard surfaced thickness shall not be considered in determining the grade; otherwise the defects admissible in rough and dread stock shall be the same for like kinds and grades.
4. These rules define the poorest piece in any given grade, but the respective grades shall contain all pieces up to the next higher grade.
5. The grade shall be determined from the better face of the board. In Selects & Bettir the reverse side shall grade not below No. 1 Common. In No. 2 Common, the reverse side shall not prevent the serviceability of this unlity grade.

**Measurement & Tally**
6. Lumber of standard size shall be tallied board measure. In lumber of standard thickness less than 1 inch, the board-foot measurement shall be based on the surface dimensions. In lumber measured with a board rule a piece tally in face shall be made and thin tally shall be the number of feet board measure of 1-inch lumber. The tally of lumber thicker"
43,"than 1 inch shall be multipled by the thickness as expressed in inches and fractions of an inch.
7. In material measured with a board rule, random width pieces measuring to the even half foot shall be alternately counted as of the near higher and lower foot count fractions below the half foot shall be dropped and fractions above the half foot shall be counted as of the near higher foot.
8. Lumber shipped on sock or specified widths shall be called by the number of pieces of each size and length.
9. Recommended Saving Sizes: When fresh warm, stock widths should be 1/4"" to 1/2"" over nominal width. When dry, stock widths must be full width allowing 10% 1/8"" scant in width. When dressed two-edges pieces less than 8"" wide can be 1/2"" scant of the nominal width. Piezes 8"" and wider can be 3/4"" scant of the nominal width. All grades shall be stock widths, unless otherwise specified.
10. Lumber having greater variation in thickness, except as to wane, between the thinnest and thickest points, than shown in the following table shall be measured for thickness at the thinnest point and closed as miscut, and shall be graded and reported as such. * 1/16"" in thickness of 3/8"" and 1/12"" * 1/8"" in thicknesses of 5/8"" and 3/4"" * 1/4"" in thickness of 1"" to 2"" * 3/8"" in thickness of 2-1/2"" and 3"" * 1/2"" in thicknesses of 4"".

## Moisture Contents

13. Standard thickness for rough lumber are: 1"", 1-1/4"", 1-1/2"", 1-3/4"", 2"", 2-1/2"", 3"", 3-1/2"", 4"", 4-1/2"", 5"", 5-1/2"", and 6"". Thickness may also be expressed in quarter inches as follows: 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4, 8/4, 10/4, 12/4, 14/4, 16/4, 18/4, 20/4, 22/4 and 2/4/4.
14. Thickness in rough saw lumber must be 1/16"" to 1/8"" over nominal "
44,"thickness. When dry, lumber must be full thickness allowing 10% 1/16"" scan.

### Warp and Cup

15. Entire board must be flat enough to surface both sides at 1/4"" less than nominal thickness, no skip allowed.

### Definition of Defects & Blemishes

16. When defects or blemishes, or combinations thereof, not described in these grading rules are encountered, they will be considered as equivalent to known defects according to their damaging effect upon the piece in the grade under consideration.
17. Standard definitions of the defects and blemishes usual in Cypress are as follows:
18. A defect is defined as any irregularity occurring in or on wood that may lower some of its strength, durability, or utility values.
19. A blemish is defined as anything not classified as a defect, marking the appearance of the wood.

### Checks

20. A check is a lengthwise separation of the wood, which occurs usually across the rings of annual growth.
21. A surface check is a check occurring on the surface of the piece.
22. A small surface check is a perceptible opening, not over 4"" long.
23. A medium surface check is one not over 1/32"" wide and over 4"" but not noce than 10"" long.
24. A large surface check is one over 1/32"" wide and over 10"" long.
25. An end check in one occurring on an end of a piece.
26. A through check is one extending from one surface through the piece to the opposite surface or to an adjoining surface.
27. A heart check is one starting at the pith and extending toward but not to the surface of the piece.

 "
45,"Decay & Peck
* 28. Decay is a disintegration of the weed substance due to the action of the weed-destroying fungi. The wards ""date"" and ""rot"" mean the same as decay.
* 29. Incipient decay is the early stage of decay in which the disintegration has not proceeded far enough to soften or otherwise change the harden of the wood percepribly. It is usually accompanied by a slight disclotation or bleaching of the wood.
* 30. Advanced (or typical) decay is the older stage of decay in which the disintegration is readily recognized because the wood has become punky, soft and spongy, stringy, ring shaked, pitted, or crumely. Decided discoloration or bleaching of the rooted wood is often apparent.
* 31. A peck is typical decay which appears in the form of a hole, pocket, or area of soft rot usually surrounded by sound wood. Slight peck is not through the piece occupying less than 10% of the surface area.

### Holes

32. Holes in wood may extend partially or entirely through the piece and be from any cause. When holes are permitted the average of the maximum length and maximum width shall be used in measuring the size, unless otherwise noted.
* 33. A pin worm hole is one roof over 1/16"" in diameter.
* 34. A medium worm hole is one roof 1/16"" but not more than 1/4"" in diameter.
* 35. A large worm hole is one roof 1/4"" in diameter.

* 42. A spike knot is a branch or limb saved in a lengthwise direction.
* 43. A round knot is solid across its face, as hard as the surrounding wood, and shown no indications of decay. It may vary in color from red to black.
* 44. An unsound knot will not impair the strength of the board.
* 45. A decayed knot is softer than the surrounding wood and contains advanced decay.
* 46. A tight knot is one to fixed by growth or position that it will firmly retain its place in the piece.
* 47. An inner-right knot is one whose rings of annual growth are completely intergrown with those of the surrounding wood.
* 48. A water-tight knot is one whose rings of annual growth are completely intergrown with those of the surrounding wood on one surface of the piece, and which is sound on that surface.
* 49. An encased knot is one whose rings of annual growth are not intergrown and homogenous with those of the surrounding wood. The encased ring may be partial or complete.
* 50. A loose knot is one not held firmly in place by growth or position and cannot be relied upon to remain in place in the board.
* 51. A fifth knot is a second knot with a pitch hole not more than 1/4"" in diameter.
* 52. A hollow knot is an apparently sound knot with a relatively large hole in it.

### Manufacturing Defects

53. Manufacturing defects include all defects or blemishes which are produced in manufacturing, such as chipped grain, loomend grain, rained grain, torn grain, machine burn, and machine gauge.

 "
47,"* 54. Chipped grain means that a part of the surface is chipped or broken out in very short particles below the line of cur. It should not be classed as corn grain and, as usually found, shall not be considered a defect unless it is present in excess of 25% of the area.
* 55. Loosened grain means that a small portion of the wood has become loosened but not displaced.
* 56. Raised grain is a raughened condition of the water of dressed lumber in which the hard summer wood is raised above the water spring wood, but not corn loose from it.
* 57. Tom grain means that a part of the wood is ten out in dressing, and in depth in four dainter charects; slight, medium, heavy and deep.
* 58. Slight turn grain is not over 1/32"" in depth.
* 59. Medium corn grain is over 1/32"", but not more than 1/16"" in depth.
* 60. Heavy corn grain is over 1/16"", but not more than 1/8"" in depth.
* 61. Deep corn grain is over 1/8"" in depth.
* 62. A skip is an area on a piece that failed to surface.
* 63. A slight skip is one that failed to surface smoothly, whose area does not exceed the product of the width of the piece in inches multiplied by 6.
* 64. A heavy skip is one that the planet knife did not touch.
* 65. A machine burn is a darkening or charting of the wood due to overheating by the machine knees.
* 66. A machine pump is a groove across a piece due to the machine cutting below the desired line of cur.

## Shake

* 68. A fine shake is one with a barely perceptible opening.

 "
48,"* 69. A slight shake is one with more than a perceptable opening but not over 1/32\({}^{*}\) in width.

* 72. A through shake is one extending from one surface through the pierce to the opposite surface or to an adjoining surface.
* 73. A round shake is one completely encircling the pink.
* 74. A cup shake is one that does not completely encircling the pink.

## 75. A split is a lengthwise separation of the wood due to the rearing apart of the wood cells.
* 76. A short split is one not exceeding in length either the width of a piece or one-south is length.
* 77. A medium split is one exceeding in length the width of a piece but does not exceed one-width its length.
* 78. A long split is one exceeding in length one-width of the length of the pierce.

## 76. Stain (or Discoloration)
* 79. Stain is a dislocation, occurring on or in lumber, of any color other than the natural color of the pierce, on which it appears. It is classified as light medium and heavy.
* 80. Light stain is a slight difference in color which will not materially impair the appearance of the pierce if given a natural finish.
* 81. Medium stain is a pronounced difference in color which, although it does not obscure the grain of the wood, would customarily be objectionable in a natural but not in a poisoned finish.
* 82. Heavy stain is a difference in color so pronounced as practically to obscure the grain of the wood.

"
54,"* Allowable defects could be a small (1/2"") sound knot in the center, a crack less than 1/32"" wide and 3"" long, or an unusual knot or crack in the very end of the board that does not exceed more than 2"" into the length of the board.

### Grades for Small, Clear Mesquite Pieces

Although small, clear mesquite number pieces are eminently useful for a variety of purposes, if their widths or lengths are too small, they cannot be classified according to rough lumber grades. Accordingly, the following grades were adopted from the National Dimension Manufacturers Association for small furniture pieces:

#### Cif (clear ONE FACE)

This material shall be clear on one side or face, both edges and both ends, and shall otherwise comply with the clear free face quality, except that the reverse face may contain defects of sound quality.

#### Cif (clear TWO FACE)

This material shall be clear on both faces, the edges, and the ends, except that layered, light streaks, small burls or swirls and light stain shall be permitted.

#### Core

This material shall be sound on both faces admitting tight sound knots, small worm holes, slight surface checks or their equivalent.

#### Sound INTENTOR

This material may contain any defects that will not necessarily impair the strength of the individual piece for the use intended.

#### Sound FRAME

Same as for sound interior.

## Tropicl Hardwoods

Cidi lengths are admitted without limit.

Fractions of over one-half font in length shall be counted up, and fractions of one-half font or less in length shall be dropped, except in the grades of Shorts. This does not change the maximum length requirements of the respective grades.

Saproed is not allowed in the cutting on both faces in all grades.

#### FAsi

Standard, except: Pieces of 4"" and 5"" surface measure shall yield 11/12 (91-2/3%) clear face in one-cutting.

## Chapter INSPECTION OF KILN DRIED LUMBER

### Measurement After Kiln Drying

The Model Stare Regulation adopted by the National Conference on Weights and Measures on July 21, 1977 specifies that: ""Sales of hardwood lumber measured after kiln drying shall be quoted, invoiced, and delivered on the basis of net board footage, with no addition of footage for kiln drying shrinkage.""

### Measurement Before Kiln Drying

It also stores, ""Sales of hardwood lumber measured prior to kiln drying shall be quoted, invoiced, and delivered on the basis of net board footage before kiln drying. If the lumber is to be kiln dried as the request of the purchaser, the kiln drying charge shall be clearly shown and identified on the quotation and invoice.""

This regulation is recognized as law in many states and NHLA members are cautioned to consult applications of the states in which they do business.

When inspecting kiln dried lumber National Inspectors will make no addition for estimated kiln shrinkage.

In contracts for kiln dried lumber, the Standard Kiln Dried Rule shall apply unless otherwise specified in the sales contract.

### Standard Kiln Dried Rule

Kiln dried lumber will be graded and measured as such, the grading rules for air dried lumber to be applied in all respects, unless otherwise specified. Rough kiln dried lumber specified 3/8"" to 1-3/4"" thick may be 1/16"" scant of the nominal thickness, 2"" and thicker may be 1/8"" scant and the 10% of scant quotenced lumber admitted by Paragraph 36, may be 3/32"" scant on one side in 1"" to 1-1/2"" lumber and 3/16"" on one side in 2"" and thicker. The minimum widths mentioned in all grades may be 1/4"" scant in width and the 10% admitted by Paragraph 10 may be 1/2"" scant in width. In other respects the rules for grading are dried lumber shall apply:

National Inspectors will mark certificates under these specifications ""Standard Kiln Dried Rule Applied."""

**Klin Drying of Hardwood Lumber**

**Note:**: _In order to minimize dimensional changes in metric, hardwood Lumber and for work product want have moisture removed by placing it in a dry biking with controlled humidity and bear for a period of time determined by the starting and the desired moisture content, the precise, and the thickness. Other advantages of biking drying are the mixing of water and the filling of ironic acid organization canring strain and decay_

Moisture concern of wood in ordinarily expressed as the percentage of the weight of water in the wood to the oven dry weight of the wood. Lumber with a moisture content above 30% is considered as green or partly air dried lumber. The moisture content of air dried lumber is generally from 15% to 30%. Dry kilns usually dry hardened lumber so a moisture content of foam 6% to 10%, and kiln dried lumber will gradually adjust to the humidity of its final location.

Klin drying is a specialized technical process. Custom kiln drying is a commercial agreement between the kiln operator and the owner of the lumber. Shrinkage of hardwood lumber in kiln drying varies from about 3% to 9%, depending on species and initial dryness (shrinkage values of individual species can be found in technical references below). Some degrade also occurs in kiln drying.

**Fees Charged to Members**

The charge to members for service of inspectors is on a straight per deem basis regardless of species and type of inspection. One quarter or one half of the per diem rate may be charged for a partial day when the inspector is able to complete the days work at a nearby location.

**Expenses for transportation, room and meals will be charged to the member. For time lost after the inspector has reported for service due to lack of proper facilities for handling the number, lack of suitable stock, or for other delays beyond the control of the inspector, except weather conditions, the regular per diem charge will be made.**"
71,"Charges for instruction by members of the inspection staff are at the same per diem rate as other services plus expenses for transoperation, room and meals. Charges for special or unusual services may be obtained by calling the Executive Office.

The per diem inspection rate and mileage charges are adjusted from time to time by the Board of Managers. Current races may be obtained by calling the Executive Office.

### Inspection Services to Non-Members

Non-members may obtain official inspection services at per diem charges 50% higher than those listed in the schedule in lieu of membership dues. Actual traveling and hotel expenses will be charged. An advance deposit to cover the costs will be requested. Application for these services is to be made to the Executive Office to avoid delay.

## Original National Inspection regulations

1. All applications for an Original Inspection on grades in this book shall be made in writing to the Chief Inspector or to an authorized National Inspector of the Association. Appliances will avoid delay by calling ahead and then mailing or facing the application for an Original Inspection direct to the National Inspector nearest the point where the inspection is to be made, and sending a copy of the application to the Chief Inspector at: P.O. Box 34518 | Memphis, TN 38184-0518, USA | (901) 382-6419 Fax

**Note:**_The ward ""Inviser interface interface and planning as defined in their base._
2. An application for an Original Inspection may request that the inspection be made at the point of origin or at the destination when authorized in the purchaser contract or by special agreements. It should be thoroughly understood that no member or officer of the Association possess the authority to impose an Original Inspection upon any seller or buyer. When an Original Inspection has been made, it is binding only upon those parties who agreed beforehand to recognize it in the individual transaction in which it is involved. A buyer or seller may desire that the National Rules for grading and measurement apply to a contract and then specify ""National Rules to Govern,"" without "
72,"necessarily obligating either party to be bound by the results of an Original Inspection performed by a National Inspector. It is therefore, absolutely necessary in any transaction involving the sale or purchase of lumber in which a buyer or seller relies upon the results of an Original Inspection by a National Inspector for the protection of his interests, that it be clearly stated in the contract of sale or purchase that an Original Inspection is to be binding on the parties. The following provision is recommended to be included in contracts where the Original Inspection is intended to be binding on the parties: The number described in this contract is subject to and the parties are bound by an Original Inspection by a National Inspector according to the rules and regulations of the National Hardwood Lumber Association.
* The contract of sale should also state whether the seller or the buyer is to apply for the Original Inspection, whether the inspection is to be made at point of origin or at destination and the time limit within which the application is to be made to the Association for the Original Inspection. The point of Original Inspection may be governed by the convenience in securing the services of a National Inspector.
* When an Original Inspection is agreed to in a sales contract, the contract should provide for the allocation of the expense of the inspection between the buyer and seller. The inspection expense may be divided between the buyer and seller or may be borne entirely by either party, but a bill for the expense as established by the Association from time to time will be rendered by the Association to the party calling for the inspection, which bill is immediately due and payable.
* In an Original Inspection, a National Inspector is required to inspect the full amount of lumber contained in a shipments and he is expressly forbidden from making an Original Inspection of a portion of a shipment after selections have been made therefrom, unless both seller and buyer agree thereto.
* In the absence of signed instructions to the contrary, a National Inspector will inspect and measure lumber according to ""Standard Inspection"" and ""General Instructions,"" as provided by the rules in this book.
* Upon completion of an Original Inspection, the National Inspector will cause the lumber that his been inspected so be placed down.

The National Inspector shall compete and sign a Certificate of Original Inspection certifying to the amount and grade of lumber so inspected and shall note on the Certificate whether or not the Original Inspection is subject to the ""Financial Guarantee"" of the Association. The National Inspector shall deliver a copy of the Certificate to the party requesting the inspection and to the office of the Chief Inspector.
* The Financial Guarantee of the Association does not apply to lumber that has been inspected in an Original Inspection unless (1) the inspected lumber has been strapped and scaled, (2) the Certificate of Original Inspection has been completed and signed by the National Inspector with the notation ""Subject to Association Financial Guarantee"" duly noted thereon, (3) the party requesting the inspection forwards one copy of the Certificate of Original Inspection to the other party within three (3) days after receipt of the Certificate from the inspector and (4) if the lumber was inspected at the point of origin, the lumber was forwarded to its destination within seven days after completion of the Original Inspection.
* The Association's Financial Guarantee does not apply to an inspection where:
* The application contains a request for special grades requiring a higher, more rigid, more technical or more difficult grade than is published in this book;
* The specifications are subject to burrit's or seller's interpretation;
* The specifications require that the lumber be entirely free of worm holes, worm or insect infestation, ingeom bark, does, stain or that the lumber be straight and flat; or
* The specifications which require that the lumber, or the curing, be entirely free of checks, burk, mineral streaks, splits, bird's eye, cross palm, curly or swisted grain or that the lumber be straight grained.
* An application for an inspection of the types described in subsection (a) shall be made in writing to the Chief Inspector and shall be interpreted by the Chief Inspector as a request for a Special Inspection and assigned to an appropriate National Inspector with
 "
74,"proper instructions. The Financial Guarantee of the Association will not apply to this type of Special Inspection and the National Inspector conducting this type of inspection shall note on the Certificate, ""Special Inspection Not Subject to Association Financial Guarantee."" Failure of a National Inspector to insert this location on the Certificate will not alter the limitation of the Financial Guarantee.
* [X] Nacional Inspectors will not certify to recurse, moisture content, degree of dryness or weight. If the lumber being inspected is green lumber, the Certificate will be marked accordingly.
* [X] When the Financial Guarantee is desired on lumber to be kiln dried in transit after the Original Inspection, it is necessary that the National Inspector be introduced by the party ordering the inspection to place an identification mark for grade and surface measure on each piece. The mask of identification will be noted on the Certificate and the Certificate marked ""For Kiln Drying"". The surface measurement marked on each board shall be used in tallying and grading if re-respected after kiln drying, in accordance with Section XI of Re-impetitian Regulations. If the lumber is not placed in the kiln within twenty days after the Original Inspection the Financial Guarantee is terminated.
* [X] Upon Completion of an Original Inspection in accordance with Section VII (on page 73), the Certificate shall be binding on the parties unless an Official Re-impetitian is requested. If the Original Inspection was made at the point of origin, all applications for re-impetitian shall be made within fourteen days from receipt of the lumber at destination. If the Original Inspection was made at the destination, the application for re-impetitian shall be made within fourteen days from date of Original Inspection. If a re-impetitian is requested, the party requesting the re-impetitian is responsible for preserving the official NHLA seal from each bundle of lumber involved in the Original Inspection.

## 7 Conclusion

In this paper, we have developed a new method for the determination"
77,"thickness or thicknesses reported in the original Certificate nor credit taken for species of a value higher than that reported on the original Certificate. A species of a lesser value than that reported on the original Certificate is to be credited at its respective lesser value. Species found in the Official Re-inspection which are not shown on the original Certificate are to be accepted at the prices determined according to the above evaluation but they are not so be considered in determining the Association's liability for the payment of a claim.
6. All claims for payment under the Financial Guarantee shall be presented within 30 days after the date of Official Re-inspection, otherwise the Association's Financial Guarantee does not apply. The Association does not under any circumstances take possession of lumber or dispose of it.
7. In all cases where claims are approved on the four percent money value claim, the Association will assume a labor cost for handling the amount of lumber re-inspected at actual cost or at the rate of $15.00 per M feet, whichever is less. No claim will be approved and passed for payment where handling charges are in excess of these rates. In cases which claims are approved, the Association charges for the Official Re-inspection will be canceled. The Association assumes no liability on account of demurage or for any other expense than an herein provided.
8. If the difference in favor of the party complaining does not exceed four percent in money value, the party demanding the Official Re-inspection shall pay all expenses commenced therewith.
9. All limitations upon the applicability of the Financial Guarantee of the Association contained in the Original Inspection Regulations are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof an if act forth in verbatim.
10. In addition to the foregoing, in making and Official Re-inspection of a seal strapped and sealed shipment, warp, stain and checks shall be considered defects. The Financial Guarantee will apply in Certificates denoting green lumber and on all lumber loaded on open rail cars and open trucks, except that stain, season checks, spikes, warp and twist shall be disregarded in conducting the Official Re-inspection when ordered on the complaint of the buyer. The Association reserves the right to decline to make an Official Re-inspection and the Financial "
78,"Guarantee will not apply to lumber shipped in leaky cars or delayed beyond a reasonable period in transit, or which does not arrive at destination in its original container.
* [Xl] The Financial Guarantee does not apply on lumber that has been dressed or worked after completion of the Original Inspection; provided, however, that the Financial Guarantee applies on lumber kiln dried in transit after the Original Inspection has been completed, only when all of the conditions of Section 11 of Original Inspection Regulations have been complied with. Official Re-inspection will then be gamed on complaint of the buyer when requested in accordance with the same regulations governing re-inspection of air dried lumber except that it should be understood that the Association assumes no liability for any shortage in measurement, scant thickness, or proper kiln drying and that in conducting the Official Re-inspection the inspector will tally and grade on the measurement marked on the boards before kiln drying, will consider only the nominal thickness and will disregard checks, honeycomb, splits and warp in grading.

When price at shipping point is agreed upon, the buyer assumes all liability for any increase in freight rate and receives the benefit arising from any reduction in freight rate.

**ARTICLE X = Inspection**

Section 1.: Number sold under this code is subject to the current rules for grading and measurement of the National Hardwood Number Association.

Section 2.: When the order provides for an Original Inspection, the number is subject to inspection under the Original Inspection Regulations and the Re-inspection Regulations which govern"
82,"the Inspection Department of the National Hardwood Lumber Association and the Financial Guarantee of the Association shall apply as therein provided.
* When a shipment of lumber is received under an order which did not require an Original Inspection, the buyer shall cause the shipment to be inspected and measured. If an unsatisfactory difference exists between the amount of seller's invoice covering the shipment and the value of the shipment computed from the buyer's measurement and inspection, the buyer shall hold the entire shipment intact and report this difference to seller within fourteen days after unloading the shipment and furnish seller with piece tally, unless buyer and seller agree otherwise. If it be impossible to adjust such difference by congeomise, an authorized National Inspeccor of the National Hardwood Lumber Association shall be called to inspect the lumber under dispute.
* If the buyer and the seller agree in writing, the application to the Chief Inspector or to an authorized National Inspeccor may request that the lumber be inspected as an ""Original Inspection"" under the Original Inspection Regulation and the Re-inspection Regulations and the Financial Guarantee of the Association shall apply an the terms and conditions therein provided. The buyer and seller must agree in writing that the Original Inspection is to be binding on the parties.

 "
83,"* [26] M. C. C. _et al._, ""The "
84,"to the NHLA against whom the complaint was made. Such member shall be notified of its right to appeal, and any appeal shall be decided by the Inspection Services Committee. Pending disposition of the appeal, the complaint and the warning letter shall remain confidential. If no appeal is made or if the appeal is dismissed, then the NHLA may disclose to any NHLA member making inquiry that a warning was sent, the date on which the warning was sent, and whether any other warnings had been sent.

* If it becomes apparent that the seller cannot make delivery of such covered by an order, or if delivery of the stock on the order, or any portion thereof, is unreasonably delayed, the buyer may cancel the order or any unfilled portion thereof.

**Note:**_The fact that the seller has anvaded his revoke, or the fact that the buyer has anv-purchased his requirements, is in writher case a justifiable reason for arbitrary cancellation. Neither does the condition of the number bear any redivisw to the invenability of a contract of a vidt and purchase. If also market goes down, the buyer is obliged to receive the stock purchased by him. If the number gain up, the seller is obliged to deliver and receive payment for the stock sold by him. Cancellation of an order by either party for any of those reasons is wolly without warrant, and is in a similar apposition to the letter and spirit of their said, which is based upon the principle of grand faith and against datalog._

* In order to adjust disputes arising between seller and buyer in the application of the principles of this code arbitration is recommended.
* The customary procedure in arbitration cases is to select an arbitrator and in the event the buyer and seller cannot agree "
85,"upon a sole arbitraou, each party should select one. If these two arbitraou's shall disagree, they shall elect a third arbitrator and a majority decision of these arbitraou's shall be binding upon the parties to the dispute.

**Note:**_This Code is binding between buyer and seller only sober it is specifically shared in the correct but is still given._

**Tips and Short Cuts**

1. To determine 2/3 the width of the board, use the 16' scale on the lumber scale and divide by 2.

2. To determine value for upgrading, obtain the percentage difference between lumber pieces, then divide 100 by the surface measure. When reducing the surface measure percentage, do not exceed the percentage difference of the pieces.

**EXAMPLE** FAS $1200 - 1 Common $850 divided by

FAS $1200 - 298. The board: 100 divided by 6' SM = 16.66%, removing 1 foot SM will be profitable.

3. To determine the amount of side bend in a board, stand the board on its edge and measure the bend as its greatest distance from a straight line. When taking full length cuttings, this amount must be deducted from the total width of the cutting.

**EXAMPLE** A board 6"" wide and 10"" long with a 1"" bend would allow a maximum 5"" wide, full length cutting.
