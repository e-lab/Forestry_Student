6,True or False  The branches of northern white-cedar can take root if the tree falls answer in a  format only please!,"  FalseExplanation: According to the text ""Because of its characteristically shallow root system and weak root hold in the spongy organic soils white-cedar cannot withstand severe winds and many mature trees are felled in storms."" Therefore it is unlikely that the branches of a fallen northern white-cedar would take root.","[Document(page_content='t development (33).\nAfter the seedling stage northern white-cedar generally develops \na shallow, wide-spreading root system; and natural root grafts are \nfairly common. Because the tree grows on rocky cliffs throughout \nits range, the root system is apparently well adapted to secure \nwater and nutrients from cracks in rocks (10).\nReaction to Competition- Northern white-cedar is classed as \nshade tolerant, but it has been placed in three classes: very \ntolerant, tolerant, and intermediate. This variation probably exists \nbecause vegetative reproduction is considered more tolerant than \nseedlings (9). Northern white-cedar is less tolerant than balsam \nfir but slightly more tolerant than black spruce. White-cedar can \nwithstand severe suppression for several years, and it responds \nwell to release not only during the reproduction period but at \nnearly all ages (3,16).\nResponse to thinning northern white-cedar depends upon site \nquality, residual stand density, and stand age. In a well-dra'), Document(page_content='entially, white-cedar is a relatively long-lived species. \nAccording to one source, some trees have reached 1,000 years of \nage, although stand age rarely exceeds 200 years (6).\nRooting Habit- Atlantic white-cedar has a shallow root system. In \nswamps where the lower soil layers are permanently saturated \nwith water, the roots are confined chiefly to the upper 1 to 2 feet \nof peat. Where the water table occurs at lower levels and the soils \nare more deeply aerated, the roots often penetrate to greater depths.\nThe small taproot formed during the first year is subsequently lost \nin the development of the strong superficial lateral roots. These are \nnumerous but do not become large. Because of its \ncharacteristically shallow root system and weak root hold in the \nspongy organic soils, white-cedar cannot withstand severe winds, \nand many mature trees are felled in storms.

What little \nis known has been gleaned from observations of windthrown trees. \nMature white fir rooting habit appears to be fairly adaptable: deep \nand intensive where soil conditions permit or shallow and \nwidespread where rocks or seasonal water tables limit effective \nsoil depth. There is no strong tendency to maintain a single deep \ntaproot, although rapid taproot development is critical for survival \nof new germinants in the dry summer climate.\nWhite fir is susceptible to windthrow following partial cutting, \nespecially when marginal codominant and lower crown classes are \nleft as the residual stand.

Pure stands of white pine \nseldom stagnate because of inherent variations in vigor. This \ncharacteristic is more pronounced on better sites and in natural \nstands than in plantations (6).\nIn Ontario, on upland sites white pine and its associates are rated \nin decreasing order of shade tolerance as follows: balsam fir \n(Abies balsamea), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American \nbeech (Fagus grandifolia), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), \nwhite spruce (Picea glauca), yellow birch, white pine, black \nspruce (Picea mariana), gray birch (Betula populifolia), red oak \nQuercus rubra), red maple (Acer rubrum), red pine (Pinus \nresinosa), jack pine, trembling aspen, bigtooth aspen, and pin \ncherry (Prunus pensylvanica) (71).\nIn the seedling stage, white pine is very susceptible to \ncompetition because its height growth is slow compared to most \nof its associates.

Mycorrhizae are an important component of the fine roots \n(143) of most conifer species (89), but only a few of the fungi that \nform mycorrhizae have been found on white spruce.\nRoot grafting appears to be fairly common in white spruce. In one \nstudy, about 27 percent of the trees had root grafts with other trees \n(140,149).\nReaction to Competition- White spruce is intermediate in \ntolerance to shade. It is equally or less tolerant to shade than black \nor red spruce, hemlock (Tsuga spp.), balsam and alpine fir, sugar \nmaple, and beech (Fagus spp.). It is more tolerant than aspen, \npaper birch, and lodgepole pine.\nLarge numbers of white spruce may become established \nimmediately following disturbance and form even-aged stands. \nBecause seedling and juvenile growth of white spruce is slower \nthan its early successional associates, it remains in the understory \nfor 50 to 70 years (2'), Document(page_content=""m.

It is most accurately classed as tolerant of \nshade. Red fir seedlings are slightly more hardy in full sun than \nwhite fir seedlings but become established most easily in partial \nshade (14,26).\nRed fir can carry large basal areas per unit area and maintain high \ngrowth rates for an unusually long time, partly as a result of its \nshade tolerance.

18,True or False  The fruit of bur oak has a fringed cap answer in a  format only please!, I don't know the answer to your question because the information provided does not mention anything about the fruit of bur oak having a fringed cap.,"[Document(page_content=""owth\nFlowering and Fruiting- Water oak is monoecious; staminate \nflowers are in hanging catkins and pistillate flowers are in few-\nflowered, short-stalked clusters on the same tree. They develop \nshortly before or at the same time as the new leaves. Staminate \nflowers are produced near the tip of the previous year's growth, \nwhile pistillate flowers are produced in the junction of the current \nyear's growth (5). The fruit, an acorn, matures about September of \nthe second year. The embryo has no endosperm but two large, \nfleshy cotyledons (4).\nFlowers are easily killed by late frosts after leaf buds open. The \ntrees then defoliate and develop new leaves but do not generate a \nsecond crop of flowers.\nSeed Production and Dissemination- Trees bear seed at about \nage 20 and production seems to alternate between prolific and \nlean years. Mature trees yield 9 to 53 liters (0.25 to 1.5 bu) of \nacorns in a good year, with about 64.4 kg/ha (50 lb/bu). The \naverage for cleaned seeds is 880/kg (40""), Document(page_content=' 20–22c). \nThe most common of the dehiscent simple dry fruits is the cap-\nsule, which is derived from a compound ovary (of more than \none carpel). Capsules release their seeds in a variety of ways. \nIn the poppy family (Papaveraceae), for example, the seeds are \noften shed when the capsule splits longitudinally, but in some \ndue to the presence of betacyanins. No anthocyanins occur in \nthese plants, and the families characterized by betacyanins are \nclosely related to one another.\nEvolution of Fruits\nJust as flowers have evolved in relation to pollination by many \ndifferent kinds of animals and other agents, so have fruits \nevolved for dispersal in many different ways. Fruit dispersal, like \npollination, is a fundamental aspect of the evolutionary radia-\ntion of the angiosperms.

Carter and Albert G. Snow, Jr.\nVirginia pine (Pinus virginiana) has a definite place among trees \nof commercial importance in spite of once being considered a \n""forest weed"" and called scrub pine. Also known as Jersey pine \nand spruce pine, it does so well in reforesting abandoned and \ncutover lands that it has become a principal source of pulpwood \nand lumber in the southeast. Virginia pine is commonly a small or \nmedium-sized tree but a record tree has been measured with 81 \ncm (31.8 in) in d.b.h. and 34.7 m (114 ft) in height.\nHabitat\nNative Range\nVirginia pine generally grows throughout the Piedmont and at \nlower elevations in the m'), Document(page_content='ines on dry ridges and on warm slopes with shallow soil \n(38).

On good sites in the Piedmont or \non cove sites in the southern Appalachians, however, growth of \nVirginia pine is inferior to the other southern pines. Natural \npruning in Virginia pine is slow because the branches are resinous.\nRooting Habit- Virginia pine is a shallow-rooted species and \nlosses from windthrow are likely to occur if old stands are thinned \nexcessively (5).\nReaction to Competition- Being intolerant of shade, Virginia \npine is a transitional type and is eventually replaced by more \ntolerant hardwood species. It is a pioneer species, coming in after \nfire, and on eroded areas or wornout old fields.

In the anthracite region of Pennsylvania, white pine \nsurvived well on spoils that fell within the pH range 5.1 to 6.5, \nand growth was better on lower slopes of the spoils than on upper \nslopes (18). On bituminous spoils in West Virginia, white pine \nsurvived best on spoils having a pH greater than 4.0 (13). Growth \non the spoils was slow for the first 5 years, but total height \nexceeded that of Scotch pine (P. sylvestris), and red pine at 10 \nyears.\nThe bark of white pine is used as an astringent and an \nexpectorant, and the wood has been used to produce white pine \ntar, which is used as an antiseptic,')]"
