Explain me the difference between Data Lakehouse and Data Warehouse.

A data lakehouse is a centralized repository that stores all of an organization's data, both structured and unstructured, in its native format. This allows for more flexibility in how the data can be analyzed and used, as well as easier integration with other systems. In contrast, a data warehouse is a structured repository that stores data in a specific format, typically optimized for querying and analysis. While data warehouses are often faster and more efficient than data lakehouses, they may not be able to handle as much data or accommodate as many different types of data.

Here are some key differences between data lakehouses and data warehouses:

1. Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its native format, without any predefined schema or structure. In contrast, a data warehouse stores data in a predefined schema, which is optimized for querying and analysis.
2. Scalability: Data lakehouses are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data, making them more scalable than data warehouses.
3. Flexibility: Data lakehouses provide more flexibility in how data can be analyzed and used, as they do not require data to be transformed into a specific format before it can be queried.
4. Cost: Data lakehouses are often less expensive than data warehouses, as they do not require the same level of maintenance and management.
5. Use cases: Data lakehouses are better suited for use cases that involve complex data processing and analysis, such as machine learning and predictive analytics. Data warehouses are better suited for use cases that involve fast querying and reporting, such as sales and marketing analytics.
6. Data types: Data lakehouses can store both structured and unstructured data, while data warehouses are typically designed to store only structured data.
7. Security: Data lakehouses provide more security features than data warehouses, as they can be encrypted at rest and in transit.
8. Governance: Data lakehouses provide more governance features than data warehouses, as they can enforce data quality and lineage policies.
9. Integration: Data lakehouses provide more integration capabilities than data warehouses, as they can integrate with multiple data sources and

While data warehouses are often faster and more efficient than data lakehouses, they may not be able to handle large amounts of unstructured data or accommodate complex data processing workflows.

Here are some key differences between data lakehouses and data warehouses:

1. Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its native format, without any predefined schema or structure. In contrast, a data warehouse stores data in a predefined schema, which is optimized for querying and analysis.
2. Scalability: Data lakehouses are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data and can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster. Data warehouses, on the other hand, can become bottlenecked as the volume of data grows.
3. Flexibility: Data lakehouses provide more flexibility in how data can be analyzed and used, as data can be stored in its native format and accessed using various programming languages and tools. Data warehouses, while optimized for querying and analysis, may have limitations in terms of the types of queries that can be performed.
4. Cost: Data lakehouses can be more cost-effective than data warehouses, especially for organizations that generate large amounts of unstructured data. This is because data lakehouses do not require the same level of maintenance and management as data warehouses.
5. Use cases: Data lakehouses are well-suited for use cases such as real-time analytics, machine learning, and IoT data processing. Data warehouses, on the other hand, are better suited for use cases such as reporting, dashboarding, and data visualization.
6. Data processing: Data lakehouses provide more flexibility in terms of data processing, allowing for more complex workflows and data pipelines. Data warehouses, on the other hand, are optimized for fast query performance and may not be able
