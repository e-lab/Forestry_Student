Explain me the difference between Data Lakehouse and Data Warehouse.

A data lakehouse is a centralized repository that stores all of an organization's data, both structured and unstructured, in its native format. This allows for more flexibility in how the data can be analyzed and used, as well as easier integration with other systems. In contrast, a data warehouse is a structured repository that stores data in a specific format, making it optimized for querying and analysis. While data warehouses are typically faster and more efficient than data lakehouses, they may not be able to handle large amounts of unstructured data or accommodate complex queries.

Here are some key differences between data lakehouses and data warehouses:

1. Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its native format, without any predefined schema or structure. On the other hand, a data warehouse stores data in a predefined schema, which makes it easier to query and analyze.
2. Scalability: Data lakehouses are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data and can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster. Data warehouses, on the other hand, can become bottlenecked as the volume of data grows.
3. Flexibility: Data lakehouses provide more flexibility in terms of how data can be stored, processed, and analyzed. They allow for the use of different storage formats, such as Parquet, CSV, and JSON, and support various data processing frameworks, such as Apache Spark and Hadoop. Data warehouses, while still flexible, are more limited in terms of the types of data they can store and the analytical capabilities they offer.
4. Cost: Data lakehouses tend to be less expensive than data warehouses, especially when it comes to storing large amounts of unstructured data. This is because data lakehouses do not require the same level of maintenance and management as data warehouses.
5. Use cases: Data lakehouses are better suited for use cases that involve complex queries, machine learning, and real-time analytics. Data warehouses, on the other hand, are better suited for use cases that involve structured data, such as sales reporting and financial analysis.
6. Data governance: Data lakehouses provide more flexibility in terms of data governance, allowing for more decentralized data management and greater

3. Flexibility: Data lakehouses provide more flexibility in how data can be analyzed and used, as data can be stored in its native format and accessed using various tools and technologies. Data warehouses, while optimized for querying and analysis, may have limitations in terms of the types of queries that can be performed.
4. Cost: Data lakehouses tend to be less expensive than data warehouses, especially when dealing with large amounts of unstructured data. This is because data lakehouses do not require the same level of processing power or storage capacity as data warehouses.
5. Use cases: Data lakehouses are often used for big data analytics, machine learning, and IoT applications, where the ability to store and process large amounts of unstructured data is important. Data warehouses, on the other hand, are often used for reporting and business intelligence, where fast query performance and easy data access are critical.
6. Data processing: Data lakehouses are designed to handle complex data processing tasks, such as data transformation, data cleansing, and data enrichment. Data warehouses, on the other hand, are optimized
