Explain me the difference between Data Lakehouse and Data Warehouse.

A data lakehouse is a centralized repository that stores all of an organization's data, both structured and unstructured, in its native format. This allows for more flexibility in how the data can be analyzed and used, as well as easier integration with other systems. In contrast, a data warehouse is a structured repository that stores data in a specific format, typically optimized for querying and analysis. While data warehouses are often used for reporting and business intelligence, they may not be able to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.

Here are some key differences between data lakehouses and data warehouses:

1. Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its native format, without any predefined schema or structure. In contrast, a data warehouse stores data in a predefined schema, which is optimized for querying and analysis.
2. Data Types: A data lakehouse can store both structured and unstructured data, while a data warehouse typically only stores structured data.
3. Scalability: Data lakehouses are designed to handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally, making them ideal for handling big data workloads. Data warehouses, on the other hand, may struggle with very large datasets and may require additional hardware or software to scale.
4. Flexibility: Data lakehouses offer more flexibility in terms of how data can be stored, processed, and analyzed. They allow for more creative and innovative ways of using data, while data warehouses are more rigid and may require more complex queries to access the data.
5. Cost: Data lakehouses can be more cost-effective than data warehouses, especially for organizations that have a lot of unstructured data. This is because data lakehouses do not require the same level of maintenance and management as data warehouses.
6. Security: Both data lakehouses and data warehouses provide security features such as encryption, access controls, and auditing. However, data lakehouses may provide more advanced security features due to their open nature.
7. Governance: Data lakehouses may provide better governance features compared to data warehouses, as they allow for more control over data quality, lineage, and metadata.
8. Integration: Data lakeh

4. Flexibility: Data lakehouses offer more flexibility in terms of how data can be stored, processed, and analyzed. They allow for more ad hoc queries and analysis, while data warehouses are typically optimized for specific use cases and may not be as flexible.
5. Cost: Data lakehouses can be more cost-effective than data warehouses, especially for very large datasets. This is because data lakehouses do not require as much processing power or storage capacity to handle unstructured data.
6. Security: Data lakehouses typically have better security features than data warehouses, as they are designed to handle sensitive data and provide more granular access controls.
7. Governance: Data lakehouses often have better governance features than data warehouses, as they are designed to handle multiple data sources and provide more control over data quality and lineage.
8. Integration: Data lakehouses are better suited for integrating multiple data sources, including structured, semi-struct
