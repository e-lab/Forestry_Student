Explain me the difference between Data Lakehouse and Data Warehouse.

A data lakehouse is a centralized repository that stores all of an organization's data, both structured and unstructured, in its native format. This allows for more flexibility in how the data can be analyzed and used, as well as easier integration with other systems.

On the other hand, a data warehouse is a repository that stores data in a structured and organized manner, making it easier to query and analyze. The data in a data warehouse is typically cleaned, transformed, and formatted into a specific schema before being loaded into the system.

Here are some key differences between data lakehouses and data warehouses:

1. Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its native format, without any predefined structure or schema. In contrast, a data warehouse stores data in a structured and organized manner, with a defined schema.
2. Data Types: A data lakehouse can store both structured and unstructured data, such as text documents, images, and videos. A data warehouse typically only stores structured data, such as relational databases.
3. Scalability: A data lakehouse is designed to handle large volumes of data and scale horizontally, making it ideal for big data analytics. A data warehouse, on the other hand, may struggle to handle very large datasets and may require more complex scaling solutions.
4. Flexibility: A data lakehouse provides more flexibility in how data can be analyzed and used, as it does not require data to be transformed or restructured before analysis. A data warehouse, on the other hand, requires data to be transformed and formatted into a specific schema before it can be analyzed.
5. Cost: A data lakehouse can be less expensive than a data warehouse, especially for organizations with large amounts of unstructured data. This is because a data lakehouse does not require the same level of data transformation and formatting as a data warehouse.
6. Use Cases: A data lakehouse is often used for big data analytics, machine learning, and IoT applications, where the ability to store and process large volumes of unstructured data is important. A data warehouse, on the other hand, is often used for reporting and business intelligence, where structured data is more important.
7. Querying: A data lakehouse allows for more


A data lakehouse is a centralized repository that stores all of an organization's data, both structured and unstructured, in its native format. This allows for more flexibility in how the data can be analyzed and used, as well as easier integration with other systems. In contrast, a data warehouse is a structured repository that stores data in a specific format, making it optimized for querying and analysis. While data warehouses are typically faster and more efficient than data lakehouses, they may not be able to handle large amounts of unstructured data or complex queries.

Here are some key differences between data lakehouses and data warehouses:

1. Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its native format, without any predefined schema or structure. In contrast, a data warehouse stores data in a predefined schema, which makes it easier to query and analyze.
2. Scalability: Data lakehouses are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data and can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster. Data warehouses, on the other hand, can become bottlenecked as the volume of data grows.
3. Flexibility: Data lakehouses provide more flexibility in how data can be analyzed and used, as data can be stored in its native format and accessed using various tools and technologies. Data warehouses, while optimized for querying and analysis, may have limitations in terms of the types of queries that can be run.
4. Cost: Data lakehouses tend to be less expensive than data warehouses, especially when dealing with large amounts of unstructured data. This is because data lakehouses do not require the same level of processing power or storage capacity as data warehouses.
5. Use cases: Data lakehouses are often used for big data analytics, machine learning, and IoT applications, where the ability to store and process large amounts of unstructured data is important. Data warehouses, on the other hand, are typically used for reporting and business intelligence, where fast query performance and easy data access are critical.
6. Data processing: Data lakehouses are designed to handle real-time data processing and streaming data, while data warehouses are optimized for batch processing.
7. Security: Data lakehouses provide more flexible security options
