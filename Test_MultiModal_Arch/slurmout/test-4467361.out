Explain me the difference between Data Lakehouse and Data Warehouse.

A data lakehouse is a centralized repository that stores all of an organization's data, both structured and unstructured, in its native format. This allows for more flexibility in how the data can be analyzed and used, as well as easier integration with other systems. In contrast, a data warehouse is a structured repository that stores data in a specific format, typically optimized for querying and analysis. While data warehouses are often used for reporting and business intelligence, they may not be able to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.

Here are some key differences between data lakehouses and data warehouses:

1. Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its native format, without any predefined schema or structure. In contrast, a data warehouse stores data in a predefined schema, which is optimized for querying and analysis.
2. Data Types: A data lakehouse can store various types of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. On the other hand, a data warehouse typically stores only structured data.
3. Scalability: Data lakehouses are designed to handle large volumes of data and scale horizontally, making them ideal for big data analytics. Data warehouses, on the other hand, may struggle with very large datasets and may require additional hardware or software to scale.
4. Flexibility: Data lakehouses offer greater flexibility in terms of data processing and analysis, as they do not require data to be transformed into a specific format before it can be analyzed. In contrast, data warehouses typically require data to be transformed into a specific format before it can be queried or analyzed.
5. Cost: Data lakehouses can be more cost-effective than data warehouses, especially for organizations that have large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. This is because data lakehouses do not require the same level of maintenance and management as data warehouses.
6. Use Cases: Data lakehouses are often used for big data analytics, machine learning, and IoT applications, while data warehouses are typically used for reporting and business intelligence.
7. Data Governance: Data lakehouses provide better data governance compared to data warehouses, as they allow for more

5. Cost: Data lakehouses can be more cost-effective than data warehouses, especially for large datasets, as they do not require as much processing power or storage capacity.
6. Security: Data lakehouses typically have stronger security controls than data warehouses, as they are designed to handle sensitive data and provide better access control and encryption.
7. Governance: Data lakehouses often have better governance capabilities than data warehouses, as they provide more granular control over data access and usage.
8. Integration: Data lakehouses can integrate with other systems and tools more easily than data warehouses, as they do not have predefined schemas or structures.
