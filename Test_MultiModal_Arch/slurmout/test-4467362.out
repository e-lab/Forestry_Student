Explain me the difference between Data Lakehouse and Data Warehouse.

A data lakehouse is a centralized repository that stores all of an organization's data, both structured and unstructured, in its native format. This allows for more flexibility in how the data can be analyzed and used, as well as easier integration with other systems. In contrast, a data warehouse is a structured repository that stores data in a specific format, typically optimized for querying and analysis. While data warehouses are often faster and more efficient than data lakehouses, they may not be able to handle large amounts of unstructured data or accommodate complex queries.

Here are some key differences between data lakehouses and data warehouses:

1. Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its native format, without any predefined schema or structure. In contrast, a data warehouse stores data in a predefined schema, which is optimized for querying and analysis.
2. Scalability: Data lakehouses are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data and can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster. Data warehouses, on the other hand, can become bottlenecked as the volume of data grows.
3. Flexibility: Data lakehouses provide more flexibility in how data can be analyzed and used, as data can be stored in its native format and accessed using various programming languages and tools. Data warehouses, while optimized for querying and analysis, may have limitations in terms of the types of queries that can be performed.
4. Cost: Data lakehouses tend to be less expensive than data warehouses, especially when it comes to storage costs, as they do not require the same level of data transformation and cleansing as data warehouses.
5. Use cases: Data lakehouses are well-suited for use cases such as real-time analytics, machine learning, and IoT data processing, where the ability to handle large amounts of unstructured data is important. Data warehouses, on the other hand, are better suited for use cases such as reporting and dashboarding, where fast query performance and data consistency are critical.
6. Data Governance: Data lakehouses provide more flexibility in terms of data governance, as data can be stored in its native format and accessed using various programming languages and tools. Data wareh

3. Flexibility: Data lakehouses provide more flexibility in how data can be analyzed and used, as they do not require data to be transformed into a specific format before it can be queried. In contrast, data warehouses are optimized for querying and analysis, so data must be transformed into a specific format before it can be queried.
4. Cost: Data lakehouses tend to be less expensive than data warehouses, as they do not require as much processing power or storage capacity.
5. Use cases: Data lakehouses are often used for big data analytics, machine learning, and IoT applications, where large amounts of unstructured data need to be stored and processed. Data warehouses, on the other hand, are often used for reporting and business intelligence, where structured data needs to be easily accessible and queryable.
6. Query performance: Data warehouses are typically faster and more efficient than data lakehouses when it comes to querying and analyzing structured data. However, data lakehouses can handle more complex queries and can process larger volumes of data than data warehouses.
