Explain me the difference between Data Lakehouse and Data Warehouse.

A data lakehouse is a centralized repository that stores all of an organization's data, both structured and unstructured, in its native format. This allows for more flexibility in how the data can be analyzed and used, as well as easier integration with other systems. A data warehouse, on the other hand, is a specific type of database designed to store data from multiple sources in a structured and organized manner, making it easier to analyze and report on.

Here are some key differences between a data lakehouse and a data warehouse:

1. Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its native format, without any predefined schema or structure. A data warehouse, on the other hand, stores data in a structured and organized manner, with a defined schema.
2. Sources: A data lakehouse can ingest data from various sources, including internal systems, external databases, and files. A data warehouse typically ingests data from a limited number of sources, such as transactional systems and external databases.
3. Data Types: A data lakehouse can store both structured and unstructured data, while a data warehouse typically only stores structured data.
4. Analytics: A data lakehouse provides more flexibility in terms of analytics, allowing for ad-hoc queries and real-time analysis of raw data. A data warehouse, on the other hand, is optimized for querying and reporting on structured data.
5. Cost: A data lakehouse can be more cost-effective than a data warehouse, especially for large amounts of unstructured data.
6. Security: A data lakehouse may have better security features than a data warehouse, as it can provide more granular access controls and encryption.
7. Ease of use: A data warehouse is generally easier to use and manage than a data lakehouse, as it has a more structured and organized approach to data storage and retrieval.
8. Performance: A data warehouse is typically faster and more performant than a data lakehouse, especially when it comes to complex queries and reporting.
9. Scalability: A data lakehouse can scale more easily and cost-effectively than a data warehouse, as it does not require as much hardware or infrastructure to handle large volumes of data.
10. Governance:


A data lakehouse is a centralized repository that stores all of an organization's data, both structured and unstructured, in its native format. This allows for more flexibility in how the data can be analyzed and used, as well as easier integration with other systems. In contrast, a data warehouse is a structured repository that stores data in a specific format, typically optimized for querying and analysis. While data warehouses are often used for reporting and business intelligence, they may not be able to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.

Here are some key differences between data lakehouses and data warehouses:

1. Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its native format, without any predefined schema or structure. In contrast, a data warehouse stores data in a predefined schema, which is optimized for querying and analysis.
2. Data Types: A data lakehouse can store both structured and unstructured data, while a data warehouse typically only stores structured data.
3. Scalability: Data lakehouses are designed to handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally, making them ideal for big data use cases. Data warehouses, on the other hand, may struggle with very large datasets and may require additional hardware or software to scale.
4. Flexibility: Data lakehouses offer more flexibility in terms of how data can be stored, processed, and analyzed. They allow for more creative and innovative ways of using data, while data warehouses are more rigid and structured.
5. Cost: Data lakehouses tend to be less expensive than data warehouses, especially when it comes to storage costs. This is because data lakehouses do not require as much processing power or infrastructure to manage large amounts of data.
6. Use Cases: Data lakehouses are often used for big data use cases such as IoT, financial services, healthcare, and retail. Data warehouses are often used for reporting and business intelligence, as well as for transactional systems.
7. Querying: Data lakehouses are optimized for ad-hoc queries and real-time analytics, while data warehouses are optimized for complex queries and reporting.
8. Security: Data lakehouses provide more flexible security options compared to data
