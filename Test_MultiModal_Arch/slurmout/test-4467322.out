Explain me the difference between Data Lakehouse and Data Warehouse.

A data lakehouse is a centralized repository that stores all of an organization's data, both structured and unstructured, in its native format. This allows for more flexibility in how the data can be analyzed and used, as well as easier integration with other systems. In contrast, a data warehouse is a structured repository that stores data in a specific format, typically optimized for querying and analysis. While data warehouses are often faster and more efficient than data lakehouses, they may not be able to handle large amounts of unstructured data or accommodate complex data processing workflows.

Here are some key differences between data lakehouses and data warehouses:

1. Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its native format, without any predefined schema or structure. In contrast, a data warehouse stores data in a predefined schema, which is optimized for querying and analysis.
2. Scalability: Data lakehouses are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data and can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster. Data warehouses, on the other hand, can become bottlenecked as the volume of data grows.
3. Flexibility: Data lakehouses provide more flexibility in how data can be analyzed and used, as data can be stored in its native format and accessed using various programming languages and tools. Data warehouses, while optimized for querying and analysis, may have limitations in terms of the types of queries that can be performed.
4. Cost: Data lakehouses can be more cost-effective than data warehouses, particularly for organizations that generate large amounts of unstructured data. This is because data lakehouses do not require the same level of maintenance and optimization as data warehouses.
5. Use cases: Data lakehouses are well-suited for use cases such as real-time analytics, machine learning, and IoT data processing. Data warehouses, on the other hand, are better suited for use cases such as reporting, dashboarding, and data visualization.
6. Data processing: Data lakehouses provide more advanced data processing capabilities than data warehouses, including real-time data ingestion, data transformation, and data cleansing. Data warehouses, while still capable of data processing,

Data warehouses, while optimized for querying and analysis, may require additional processing steps to prepare the data for analysis.
4. Cost: Data lakehouses tend to be less expensive than data warehouses, especially when dealing with large amounts of unstructured data. This is because data lakehouses do not require the same level of upfront design and planning as data warehouses.
5. Use cases: Data lakehouses are better suited for use cases that involve complex queries, machine learning, and real-time analytics. Data warehouses, on the other hand, are better suited for use cases that involve structured data and ad-hoc reporting.
6. Data types: Data lakehouses can store both structured and unstructured data, including images, videos, audio files, and text documents. Data warehouses, on the other hand, are typically designed to store only structured data.
7. Query language: Data lakehouses
