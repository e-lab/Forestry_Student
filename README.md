Introduction to FIRST: A Forestry Logic-Intensive Task Handling Framework

FIRST, an open-source software package, has been meticulously crafted to offer precise solutions for logic-intensive tasks within the field of forestry. Developed with the cutting-edge technology of Langchain, this framework harnesses a sophisticated suite of forestry tools. Among its capabilities, FIRST excels in predicting changes and distributions in forestry time series, particularly in regions where data may be limited or unknown. This academic-grade software aims to elevate the precision and efficiency of forestry-related analyses, providing a robust platform for addressing complex challenges in the domain.



## ⚠️ Note
Project Status:
This project is currently in the developmental phase and actively undergoing enhancements. The Language Model (LLM) backend is presently powered by GPT-4, with imminent plans to transition towards a multi-modal approach, specifically leveraging the Llama2 Large World Model (LWM).

Tool Integration:
The current iteration of the project features the integration of several tools designed to augment its capabilities:
- **Arxiv Search:** Facilitating exploration and retrieval of scholarly articles.
- **Web Browser:** Enabling web-based research and information gathering.
- **Calculator:** Providing computational functionality within the environment.
- **Python Interpreter:** Supporting the execution of Python code for enhanced scripting capabilities.
- **In-context QA:** Offering question-answering functionality within the context of the project.

Modality Focus:
It's important to note that the current implementation is tailored for a singular modality, specifically text. Future iterations aim to broaden the scope by incorporating a multi-modal approach, thereby enhancing the project's capacity to process and analyze diverse types of data.

## Forestry QA Dataset

We present the Forestry QA dataset, a comprehensive collection tailored for advancing the field of forestry-related question answering. This dataset encompasses a curated set of question-answer pairs derived from forestry examinations, providing real-world scenarios to test and enhance models in the domain. Additionally, the dataset incorporates question-answer pairs sourced from forestry textbooks, generated using the sophisticated language model GPT3.5. This amalgamation ensures a diverse and robust dataset, fostering the development and evaluation of question answering systems tailored specifically for forestry applications. Researchers and practitioners can utilize this dataset to benchmark their models, foster innovation, and contribute to the continuous improvement of question answering capabilities in the context of forestry.

⚠️ Future plans are to generate a multi-modal QA Dataset ⚠️

| Data File Name | File Size | Sample Size |

| TreeHugger_Exam_ans.csv      | 1 MB     | 49        |
| Multi-modal QA    | TBD MB      | TBH         |


## FIRST: Forestry Intellect Research & Technology System 
At the present stage of development, our focus is not directed towards training the model; rather, we are leveraging the capabilities of GPT-4 within the ReACT framework to facilitate seamless interaction with various tools. Our approach involves utilizing GPT-4 as a proficient language model to enhance the functionality of the ReACT framework.

Future endeavors, however, will delve into more advanced training methodologies. Specifically, our roadmap includes exploring the training of Llama2 for multimodal capabilities within the ReACT framework. This strategic shift aims to further elevate the project's capacity to process and comprehend diverse data types, laying the groundwork for a more comprehensive and versatile system.
