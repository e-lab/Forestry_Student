Explain me the difference between Data Lakehouse and Data Warehouse.

A data lakehouse is a centralized repository that stores all of an organization's data, both structured and unstructured, in its native format. This allows for more flexibility in how the data can be analyzed and used, as well as easier integration with other systems. In contrast, a data warehouse is a structured repository that stores data in a specific format, typically optimized for querying and analysis. While data warehouses are often used for reporting and business intelligence, they may not be able to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.

Here are some key differences between data lakehouses and data warehouses:

1. Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its native format, without any predefined schema or structure. In contrast, a data warehouse stores data in a predefined schema, which is optimized for querying and analysis.
2. Data Types: A data lakehouse can store both structured and unstructured data, while a data warehouse typically only stores structured data.
3. Scalability: Data lakehouses are designed to handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally, making them ideal for big data use cases. Data warehouses, on the other hand, may struggle to handle very large datasets and may require more complex architectures to scale.
4. Flexibility: Data lakehouses offer more flexibility in terms of how data can be stored, processed, and analyzed. They allow for more ad hoc queries and data processing, whereas data warehouses are typically optimized for specific types of queries and analysis.
5. Cost: Data lakehouses can be more cost-effective than data warehouses, especially for very large datasets. This is because data lakehouses do not require as much overhead in terms of data transformation and processing.
6. Security: Data lakehouses typically have better security features than data warehouses, as they are designed to handle sensitive data and provide more granular access controls.
7. Governance: Data lakehouses often have better governance features than data warehouses, as they provide more control over data lineage, data quality, and data security.
8. Integration: Data lakehouses are better integrated with other systems and tools, such as machine learning platforms, data visualization tools, and cloud storage services.

This allows for more flexibility in how the data can be analyzed and used, as well as easier integration with other systems. In contrast, a data warehouse is a structured repository that stores data in a specific format, making it optimized for querying and analysis. While data warehouses are typically faster and more efficient than data lakehouses, they may not be able to handle large amounts of unstructured data or complex queries.

Here are some key differences between data lakehouses and data warehouses:

1. Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its native format, without any predefined schema or structure. In contrast, a data warehouse stores data in a predefined schema, which makes it optimized for querying and analysis.
2. Scalability: Data lakehouses are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data and can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster. Data warehouses, on the other hand, can become bottlenecked as the volume of data grows.
3. Flexibility: Data lakehouses provide more flexibility in how data can be analyzed and used, as data can be stored in its native format and accessed using various tools and technologies. Data warehouses, while optimized for querying and analysis, may have limitations in terms of the types of queries that can be performed.
4. Cost: Data lakehouses tend to be less expensive than data warehouses, especially when dealing with large amounts of unstructured data. This is because data lakehouses do not require the same level of processing power or storage capacity as data warehouses.
5. Use cases: Data lakehouses are often used for big data analytics, machine learning, and IoT applications, where the ability to store and process large amounts of unstructured data is important. Data warehouses, on the other hand, are often used for reporting and business intelligence, where fast query performance and easy data access are critical.
6. Data processing: Data lakehouses are designed to handle complex data processing tasks, such as data transformation, data cleansing, and data enrichment. Data warehouses, on the other hand, are optimized
