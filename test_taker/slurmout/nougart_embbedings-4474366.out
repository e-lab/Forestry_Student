Explain me the difference between Data Lakehouse and Data Warehouse.

A data lakehouse is a centralized repository that stores all of an organization's data, both structured and unstructured, in its native format. This allows for more flexibility in how the data can be analyzed and used, as well as easier integration with other systems. In contrast, a data warehouse is a structured repository that stores data in a specific format, typically optimized for querying and analysis. While data warehouses are often used for reporting and business intelligence, they may not be able to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.

Here are some key differences between data lakehouses and data warehouses:

1. Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its native format, without any predefined schema or structure. In contrast, a data warehouse stores data in a predefined schema, which is optimized for querying and analysis.
2. Data Types: A data lakehouse can store both structured and unstructured data, while a data warehouse typically only stores structured data.
3. Scalability: Data lakehouses are designed to handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally, making them ideal for big data use cases. Data warehouses, on the other hand, may struggle to handle very large datasets and may require more complex architectures to scale.
4. Flexibility: Data lakehouses offer more flexibility in how data can be stored, processed, and analyzed, as they do not have predefined schemas or structures. Data warehouses, on the other hand, are optimized for specific types of queries and analyses.
5. Cost: Data lakehouses can be more cost-effective than data warehouses, especially for organizations that need to store large amounts of unstructured data.
6. Security: Data lakehouses provide better security features compared to data warehouses, as they allow for row-level security and fine-grained access control.
7. Governance: Data lakehouses provide better governance features compared to data warehouses, as they allow for data lineage and provenance tracking, and also provide better support for compliance and regulatory requirements.
8. ETL/ELT: Data lakehouses typically use ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) architecture, where data is loaded into the lake first

Here are some key differences between data lakehouses and data warehouses:

1. Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its native format, without any predefined schema or structure. A data warehouse, on the other hand, stores data in a structured format, with a defined schema that defines the relationships between different data elements.
2. Data Types: A data lakehouse can store both structured and unstructured data, such as text documents, images, and videos. A data warehouse typically only stores structured data, such as relational databases.
3. Scalability: A data lakehouse is designed to handle large volumes of data and scale horizontally, which means it can handle growing data volumes by adding more nodes to the cluster. A data warehouse, on the other hand, may struggle to handle very large data volumes and may require more complex scaling solutions.
4. Querying: A data lakehouse allows for more flexible querying of data, as users can access data directly and perform ad-hoc queries without having to go through a specific schema. A data warehouse, on the other hand, requires more structured queries, as the data is stored in a specific schema.
5. Cost: A data lakehouse can be more cost-effective than a data warehouse, especially for organizations that have a lot of unstructured data. This is because a data lakehouse does not require the same level of maintenance and management as a data warehouse.
6. Use Cases: A data lakehouse is often used for big data analytics, machine learning, and IoT applications, where the ability to store and process large amounts of unstructured data is important. A data warehouse, on the other hand, is often used for reporting and business intelligence, where the focus is on querying and analyzing structured data.
7. ETL: A data lakehouse typically does not require ETL (Extract, Transform
